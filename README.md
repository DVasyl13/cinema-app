* On the main page of the site, you are greeted with a slider of current movies. 
* Below are movie cards that link to the page of a particular movie. Going to the movie page, the user can see detailed information about the movie: description, cast, director, release date, theater run, and a link to the booking page for a particular screening. 
* The booking page shows additional information: theater number, screening time and date, and movie title.
* The main element of the page is the seating system - a screen image and interactive elements * representing a specific seat, which, when clicked, will be added to the order list on the right side of the screen. An unauthorized user will not be able to order a movie ticket. 
* The main navigation of the site is placed on the header element: a link to the main page in the form of a logo, a list of movies, a contact section, and a button for registration/login. After authentication, the user can view the entire account - his personal information and a list of purchased tickets. Personal information can be edited.
